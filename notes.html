<h1> Led Zeppelin Music Web Page</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
The purpose of this web page planned to display a list of the albums and be able to click the album, for the album cover to become bigger and a list of songs for the album would appear. With each song, the user ould click and find out the duration of the song and a picture of the artist. Due to not being able to figure out how to use multiple promises with the all function, an api with a random set of led zeppelin songs was used. the name of each song was displayed by a funciton called in the api data promise that drew a table with the name of each song and the picture of its respective album cover. with a click on the song name, the duration of the song is displayed with an on click function that calls a functon that appends a div with the duration of the song in seconds with the correspinding, clicked song name. with a hover over the album cover, the name of the album will appear as the duration does in a separate div. A clear function was writte, but when it was used in the on click functions it continued to break things, so it was left out.

the plans for this page, as discussed above will use the promise.all funciton that is already written to perform functions using the data from mulitple data sets. there is a rank aspect to the api data as well, so there is oppertunity to sort an albums songs by their rank.
